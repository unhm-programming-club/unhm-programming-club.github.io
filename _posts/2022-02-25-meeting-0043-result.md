## Election Message

Hey @Club Members elections are almost upon us. 

Elections are held in the first week of march as per our [constitution](https://unhm-programming-club.github.io/constitution/#section-2---officer-elections)

All this week, any member may nominate themselves or another member to serve in an officer role for the club. The roles are President, Vice President, Secretary, Discord Admin, Treasurer, and Quartermaster.

Next week (starting March 4th) we will begin the voting which will last 1 additional week and be on Discord.

To nominate yourself or someone else to run, say so in the #officer-elections channel on Discord.

I am stepping down as President because I transferred to another university and am ineligble to stay on. I will still participate in an advisory role and by contributing to programming projects.

This is a great opportunity to get involved with the club and have something that will look great on a resume!


### Agenda Next Meeting 3/4

- Begin elections with nominated members, to finish  on 3/11
- Work on discord bot container in server, status of that
