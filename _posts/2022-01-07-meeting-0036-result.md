### Attending

- Karl Miller
- Davis Moore

### Resolved

_No resolutions_

### Discussions 

- Davis found a polaroid camera he's been restoring.

- Discussed ideas for increasing meeting attendees:
	- Is attendance low because we spend too much time on administrative voting type stuff?
	- Is attendance low simply cause of the school demographic and cause of not getting a ton of exposure?
	- Could we do more actual programming in meetings?
	- Could we have more specific agendas and goals?

- We might need a re-vote on meeting times at some point.

- We will include it on the agenda for next week.

### Agenda next week

- How is meeting time working?
- Status of IT: We have a server! Got an email from IT about it, and they want to know what software we need and what users we should add.
- Spring club fair is on Wednesday February 2nd and we need to fill out a Fall Club recap form.
- With extra meeting time and/or after the meeting, will live code some Club Crawler and explain the code base to anyone interested in contributing to it.
